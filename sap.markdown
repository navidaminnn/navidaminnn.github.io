## **Introduction**
This report will explore the 4 months (Sept. 2024 - Dec. 2024) I spent as a full-stack developer at SAP.

## **Info About Employer**
SAP was started in 1972 by 5 founders, with its first office located in Waldorf, Germany. SAP is a business-to-business, Software as a Service (SaaS), tech company primarily focusing on ERP and CRM software, enabling companies to manage their key business processes. Some of their clients include big names such as Apple, Amazon, and Walmart!

I worked at the Waterloo office, located right in the center of the city’s tech hub. The office houses over 200 employees, with a large majority working as software developers. The employees at this office primarily work on HANA, an in-memory database management system.

## **Goals**

#### 1. To meet and become closer with many of my co-workers at SAP, including interns and full-time employees.
This goal was a success—I befriended many interns and frequently interacted with my team members. Emphasizing the social aspect of work made the workplace far more enjoyable.

#### 2. To explore what aspects of full-stack development I enjoy the most compared to previous internships.
By working on various parts of the tech stack, I discovered that I prefer backend work over frontend development. This realization will help me focus on backend roles in future co-ops.

#### 3. Act as a full-time employee rather than just an intern by taking initiative and contributing confidently.  
Approaching the co-op with this mindset made me more confident in providing input and assisting others on the team, fostering a sense of equality and collaboration.

#### 4. To work independently on my project, only asking for help when genuinely stuck.
I improved significantly as a developer by learning to identify when I needed assistance. This skill saved time and helped me become an expert on one of our team’s repositories.

#### 5. Manage time effectively for meetings, focused work, and life outside work. 
Improved time-management skills enabled me to maintain a great work-life balance while completing projects on time. Sticking to a schedule has also improved my personal life.

### Summary of Goals
These goals helped me excel on both the technical and interpersonal sides of my role. They improved my independence, time management, and communication skills, which will benefit me in future co-ops.

## **Job Description**
As a full-stack developer, I worked across the tech stack, using JavaScript, SAPUI5, HTML/CSS, and XML. I was part of the HANA Database Tooling team, which manages all web applications related to SAP HANA. Our team operated on 2-week sprints with standup calls twice a week.

In the first few weeks, I familiarized myself with the codebase by fixing small bugs across different repositories. This provided an overview of the main components I would work on throughout the co-op.

My primary project was to redesign a cost estimator tool used by clients to estimate costs based on their HANA database requirements. The redesign focused on:
- Updating the UI to match other HANA web applications.
- Adding support for a new database feature in the estimator.

I worked on this project for the majority of my internship, occasionally fixing bugs along the way.

### Interesting/Unique Aspects:
1. Global Collaboration:  
   I collaborated with a sister team in China, which highlighted so many fascinating cultural and workstyle differences during our weekly standup calls.

2. High-impact Project:  
   I worked on a highly visible project used by many of SAP’s clients. My manager even shared a story about the significant pushback received when the tool went down once!

## **Conclusion**
- Got my first software developer internship at a tech company.  
- Met and befriended many new people, both interns and long-time employees.  
- Learned a lot, not just technically but also in terms of interpersonal skills.  
- Discovered my preference for backend development, setting me up for future co-op success.  
- Worked independently on a high-impact project redesigning a cost estimator tool for SAP HANA.  
- Gained real-world software development experience through Agile methodology and design documentation.

## **Acknowledgments**
I would like to show some appreciation to everyone on my team as they were all incredibly easy to talk to and work alongside, especially my manager, Jean, who created a very welcoming environment and made it feel very easy to adjust to the internship! Also, all of the staff at the office deserve appreciation for making the co-op experience great by hosting so many events.
